# Computational B Cell Biology (c2b2)

Code for performing day-to-day bioinformatics research at WUSTL

Generally speaking,
* `bcr_*` scripts deal with BCR processing or analysis
* `cellranger_*` scripts help launch Cell Ranger runs
* `vis_*` scripts contain functions for visualization

Documentations are included in each script.

The scripts here are designed to work with these [Docker containers](https://github.com/julianqz/wustl_docker/blob/main/README.md).
